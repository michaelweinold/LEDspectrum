# ðŸŒˆ SPD to CRI Script 

_This script was used to extract CRI data from publications dating to the early days of light-emitting diodes. This data was used to better understand the advancements of light-emitting diode technology. The research project was jointly undertaken by teams of the University of Minnesota, the University of Harvard and the University of Cambridge. It was [funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/8567)._

\*Assuming a SPD with of A discrete data tuples
\**Note that as of version 1.X.X. the `luxpy.spectrum.spd` function does _not_ return the spectrum in the correct format when reading from a Pandas DataFrame or another array like structure.

#### Caveats

- Check for large discontinuities in the provided SPD to avoid errors like `cri = nan`
- Differences in CRI definitions between colour-science and luxpy
