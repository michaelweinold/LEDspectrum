# SPD to CRI Script

_This script was used to ectract CRI data from publications dating to the early days of light-emitting diodes. This data was used to better understand the advancements of light-emitting diode technology. The research project was jointly undertaken by teams of the University of Minnesota, the University of Harvard and the University of Cambridge. It was [funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/8567)._

### CRI Calculation

| Package | Function | Input of SPD with A number of data points | Default CRI Version | Documentation |

[1] Note that as of version 1.X.X. the `luxpy.spectrum.spd` function does _not_ return the spectrum in the correct format when reading from a Pandas DataFrame or another array like structure.

### Program Structure

1. Spectral data is loaded from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames
2. Negative values are set to zero
3. Values are sorted by wavelength
4. DataFrames are written to a dictionary
   `{'csv_name':DataFrame,â€¦}`

#### Caveats

- Check for large discontinuities in the provided SPD to avoid errors like `cri = nan`
- Differences in CRI definitions between colour-science and luxpy
