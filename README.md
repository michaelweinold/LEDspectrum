# SPD to CRI Script

The CRI is calculated using the Python module [colour-science 0.3.14](https://www.colour-science.org/)
based on equations in the [NIST CQS simulation 7.4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PsuU6QjUJjCX6tQyCud6ul2Tbs8rYWW9) by  _Y. Ohno and W. Davis_ given in [the source code for the 'colour_quality_cri' class](https://colour.readthedocs.io/en/develop/_modules/colour/quality/cri.html).

_This script was used to ectract CRI data from publications dating to the early days of light-emitting diodes. This data was used to better understand the advancements of light-emitting diode technology. The research project was jointly undertaken by teams of the University of Minnesota, the University of Harvard and the University of Cambridge. It was [funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/8567)._
